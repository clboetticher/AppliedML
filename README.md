# AppliedML
### Code sharing for Northwestern MS in Data Science program<br>
### MSDS 422 (Winter 2020)

The portfolio of projects in this repository cover the following:

* A1: Exploring and visualizing data
* A2: Evaluating regression models
* A3: Evaluating classification models
* A4: Random forests and gradient boosting
* A5: Principal Components Analysis (PCA)
* A6: Neural networks
* A7: Image processing with CNNs
* A8: Language modeling with RNNs

Formal reports on each project - outlining data source, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions - are contained in the [pdfs folder](https://github.com/clboetticher/AppliedML/tree/master/pdfs). 

**Course overview**<br>
The course serves as an introduction to machine learning with business applications. It provides a survey of machine learning techniques, including traditional statistical methods, resampling techniques, model selection and regularization, tree-based methods, principal components analysis, cluster analysis, artificial neural networks, and deep learning. Students implement machine learning models with open-source software for data science. They explore data and learn from data, finding underlying patterns useful for data reduction, feature analysis, prediction, and classification.

Learning outcomes include:

* Describe machine learning applications in business
* Compare traditional statistical methods and machine learning methods
* Distinguish between supervised and unsupervised learning methods
* Design studies for training and testing machine learning methods
* Evaluate machine learning models for regression and classification
* Construct trees, random forests, gradient boosted models, and neural networks
* Explore deep learning models for vision and natural language processing
